# AI Automation Portfolio

## Overview

This repository documents my journey to becoming a **professional AI Automation Engineer**. It contains structured projects, notes, and production-ready systems covering Python automation, APIs, LLMs, vector databases, agents, workflow orchestration, deployment, and job readiness.

The goal of this repository is not just learning, but demonstrating **end-to-end AI automation capability**: from problem definition → system design → implementation → deployment → documentation.

---

## Learning Objective

By completing this portfolio, I will be able to:

* Design and build AI-powered automation systems
* Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into workflows
* Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
* Create AI agents that use tools and APIs
* Orchestrate workflows using Zapier, Make, and n8n
* Deploy production-ready automation services
* Confidently apply for AI Automation and AI Engineer roles
